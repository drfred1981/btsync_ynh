
BitTorrent Sync for Yunohost.
==========

## Description 

BitTorrent Sync by BitTorrent, Inc is a proprietary peer-to-peer file synchronization tool available for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Windows Phone and BSD. It can sync files between devices on a local network, or between remote devices over the Internet via secure, distributed P2P technology.

Although not touted by the developers as an intended direct replacement nor competitor to cloud-based file synchronization services, it has attained much of its publicity in this potential role.[2] This is mainly due to the ability of BitTorrent Sync to address many of the concerns in existing services relating to file storage limits, privacy, cost, and performance.
